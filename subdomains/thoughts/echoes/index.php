<h1>Sing a Song, Paint a Picture</h1>

<i>The author recommends listening to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3ou9rSNUQnE7XYmJkUUIOc" 
target="_blank">Green Eyes - Coldplay</a> while reading this blog post or at the end if you have trouble reading 
and listening. I promise the reason behind this would be clear by the end of the post.</i><br><br>
A little bit of nostalgia always makes for a good start to a blog. Let me take you back to the years 2011 &amp; 2012, 
roughly 12 years ago now. Competitive exams to get into undergrad are huge in India and I am sure the word "JEE" will 
send  shivers down some of your spines. Mind you, these exams are pretty rigorous and "high-achieving" students often 
enlist in coaching institutes outside regular school for the last two years of high-school to prepare for these. 
Naturally, yours faithfully too 
was pretty ambitious and joined an institute that was about 32 kms (20 miles) away. <i>Everyday</i> after school, often still 
in my uniform I used to travel 30 mins on the train to learn either physics, chemistry or maths for 
about 5 hrs before making the same journey back. Sitting in the overcrowded train, peeping outside the window, the
only tool I had to block out the CHAOS was my faithful little
<a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/SP592">iPod shuffle</a> and a pair of wired earphones. For those of you who are 
too young to have ever experienced this fabulous piece of technology, I have attached a picture.

<br><br>

</center>
<br>
As you can see, 
this 3cm x 3cm beast didn't have a screen, let alone a touch screen. All you got was 5 buttons and I absolutely loved 
it. The 2GBs of memory was more than enough to hold my library of several albums by Linkin Park, Beatles 
and Akon and some very carefully hand-curated individual tracks. What I find impressive to this day is that I had 
listened to this collection over and over so many times on the same device that I could navigate from a given track to
any other track of my choice with the exact number of clicks without pausing. The tracks both playing in my ears and the
one the train ran on are burned in my brain as a single memory. 
<br><br>
Music is a huge part of my life. No, quite literally. According to <a href="https://stats.fm/aajay9470" target="_blank">
my stats.fm profile</a> last year I streamed music, just on Spotify for a total of 164,011 minutes. If you do the math, 
that is 2,733 hours or 113 days <i>continuously</i>. An average of a third of the day everyday was spent listening to music. 
The other peculiarity of this addiction is that I listen to the same track on a loop for days before I physically cannot 
listen to it anymore and then switch to another one. The roots to this habit is probably somewhere in how my library
was pretty constrained growing up thanks to the wonders of dialup internet. 
<br><br>
Music has also shaped my experiences and relations in a variety of ways. Most of my close friends know me as the guy 
who will spam music recommendations all day if you don't explicitly tell him to stop. But I have also started some
friendships over exchanging music recommendations, so it's not all bad. Naturally I have a lot of thoughts about what 
music means to me and for instance why I put a very heavy focus on the lyrics in the songs more than the music, but 
that warrants another (or several) post. <b>This one today is just about how music has created associations with 
particular events or phases in my mind.</b> Associations so strong that I cannot think of one without immediately being
reminded of the other every. single. time. Let me explain. 
<br><br>
This next experience is once again from when I was a kid and is probably the strongest association my mind has created 
between a song and an event. I had gotten my hands on this amazing strategy game 
<a href="https://www.ageofempires.com/games/aom/">
Age of Mythology</a> and I was zooming through the campaigns. Halfway through it when I got to the Egyptian campaign, I 
started playing <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/21LDnCDpGk717CR3iLMhxc" target="_blank">Red to Black - Fort Minor, 
Kenna, Jonah Matranga, Styles of Beyond</a> on a loop. This went on for several days because I had limited access to the 
computer for games. The sandy visuals, the Egyptian gods and heroes have been tied to this song permanently in my head. 
If I ever randomly hear the song somewhere I start thinking of sphinx(s) battling it out in the sand which obviously
has no relation to the lyrics in the song. I tried to find a scene from game that comes closest to this memory. 
<br><br>

<br>
I am also pretty sure that if I ever visit the deserts in Egypt, Mike Shinoda's voice will start playing in my head 
going <i>"I had a friend named Viktor, the two of us used to hang every single day..."</i>. 
<br><br>
Besides individual tracks connected to specific memories, I have also associated certain phases of my life
with certain kind of music. Like the previous examples, these associations have been created due to listening to the 
particular artist or genre going through the phase, but unlike them these associations don't actually remind me of each
other. I just from time to time find myself thinking about the similarities between the two. Specifically, I will divide
most of my adult life in 3 phases. <br><br>
The first being 4 years of undergrad where I constantly listened to an ungodly amount
of Pink Floyd (before you ask, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3b4E89rxzZQ9zkhgKpj8N4" target="_blank">Animals</a> is the best
Pink Floyd album and I will fight you over it). My then roommate and one of my current best friends 
who was also forced to listen to it, hates me for it to this day and rightfully so. Undergrad was an exciting but 
relaxing period. It was about learning to think like an adult and balance cynicism and optimism. I think Pink Floyd 
reflects this in many ways. <br>
Next was a short period of two years when I was working at Microsoft Research carrying into 
the first 6 months of grad school. I was probably the happiest I had ever been. I was making good progress in research, 
feeling accomplished, making new friends all the good stuff. I really got into listening to Alt-J during this time. If 
you have never listened to them before, Alt-J is an Alt/Indie/Psychedelic rock band. You don't really make too much 
sense of their lyrics but you have a really good time listening to their music. There are few tracks that are somewhat 
mellow but most of their songs in my opinion are pretty upbeat and positive. I think the song <a 
href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7DdXf9x75iEVCHWfoRwRuR?si=50c27c81f9484d05" target="_blank">Fitzpleasure</a> 
summarizes what I am trying to get at. <br>
Finally, most of grad school is characterized by a heavy dependence on Radiohead. I would say the comparisons in this 
one are pretty obvious. For the uninitiated, I would say Radiohead is what you turn to when you feel you are not 
in enough pain. When, you need that extra juicy bit of gut wrenching sadness! Ofcourse, my grad school experience 
is not all that sad. These are just coping mechanisms - "haha, look Radiohead sad!". If you want to get a taste of 
Radiohead, you should listen to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/35YyxFpE0ZTOoqFx5bADW8" target="_blank">Nude</a>
from the album <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5vkqYmiPBYLaalcmjujWxK" target="_blank">In Rainbows</a>, which 
is also my most played track on Spotify at a whopping 7,625 minutes of playtime.
<br><br>
I have many more such associations in my brain, the latest one from a few years ago when my labmate Tom and I were writing 
our first paper together while playing <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0jyikFM0Umv0KlnrOEKtTG" target="_blank">
My Iron Lung - Radiohead</a>, which will forever be a paper submission song for the both of us. These associations also 
are not always happy or remind me of something I enjoy. Back in 2018, I was travelling back home to be with family 
when my grandma passed away. On the way, I was playing 
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5y1jgbDNgTfxoWXv3FhH2Q" target="_blank">Little One - Highly Suspect</a>
and this song will forever remind me of her and how kind she was to me for as long as I have known her. I unfortunately
couldn't find a recent picture with her, but here is one from when I was a toddler. If you couldn't guess, I am 
second from the left in the front.

</center>
<br>
What I am trying to get at through all of this is that music is powerful! 
Maybe I am just trying to justify my habit of listening to music all-the-time, but it acts like my personal diary. 
It is a time-capsule that lets me permanently
seal experiences somewhere in my mind that are ready to pop out at the most unexpected times when the song is played. I 
am certainly curious if other people too have such associations of events with music, or perhaps with other forms of 
art, but I am glad I have my companion that is with me 8hrs/day. 

<br><br>
Finally, to answer the question - <b>why Green Eyes by Coldplay?</b> It relates to why I 
wrote this blog. I recently went through some pretty stressful events that also resulted in some physical ailments 
(all better now). While I was recovering through it, I was mainly playing this song (and one another) on a loop. I was 
thinking today about how these two songs have now been associated with the process of this recovery
and recounted the other such experiences from my past. Maybe by playing this song I can re-associate it
with something nicer like sharing this blog with you. <br><br>
