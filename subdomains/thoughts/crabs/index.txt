No, you did not read the title wrong. I didn't make a typo either. It was not supposed to be "How do we be better <i>than</i> crabs?" or "How do we <i>cook</i> better crabs?". Today I want to talk about "How do we <b>be</b> better crabs?". Let me explain. This chain of thought originated out of two unrelated events over the past week. 
<br>
<br>
... I have been home in India for more than a month now spending a much-needed break with my family. The other day I was introducing my dad to the world of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@kurzgesagt" target="_blank">Kurzgesagt</a> and the discussion landed on how the only goal for any species is to continue their survival for as long as possible. To ensure this for humans, we would eventually have to leave this planet, perhaps this solar system, and if we are lucky, become a multi-galactic species and spread our DNA to the far reaches of the universe. A really important pre-requisite for this would be figuring out how to effectively tap all the energy available on the planet, then our star and maybe several star systems in the galaxy. The discussion led us to dream of a very bright future for humanity, and why not - we as a civilization have overcome so many hurdles - discovered fire to fend off predators, tapped into earth's fossil fuel reserves starting the industrial revolution, survived several global pandemics and now according to some are at the cusp of creating machines in the image of humans. Global warming, world peace, and sustainable space travel should likewise be easy hurdles to overcome, right? ...

... Fast forward a few days, a close friend from undergrad and I were learning to surf on the beaches of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covelong" target="_blank">Covelong</a>, a city about 30 mins drive from Chennai<sup>1</sup>. After an early morning practice session, we were sitting on the beach admiring the waves when we noticed a bunch of crabs crawling in and out of the water. I don't know why but the first thought that hit me was "What do crabs as a species have to live for? They are never leaving this planet, let alone traverse galaxies and witness the heat death of the universe". The reasoning in my mind wasn't just because of their physical and mental inadequacies - lacking an opposable thumb and everything. Evolution has taken care of worse. Rather the biggest hurdle for them is the presence of another dominant species on the planet they occupy - humans. We have already won the race for survival on this planet and have grabbed all the resources for ourselves. If by some fluke of nature, crabs <i>do</i> evolve the ability to light a fire and started digging for oil, we would blast the ever-living fuck out of them before crab Elon is even born! Now obviously, they aren't aware of any of this and continue to reproduce and keep trying to inch their species forward. This is when a grim thought hit me - "What if we are the crabs of the Milkyway galaxy?". The thought soon became even more grim when I realized we are <i>likely</i> the crabs of the Milkyway galaxy - with hundreds of billions of stars, what are the chances we, a carbon-based life form that evolved just some odd 300,000 years ago is the dominant species? There HAS to be a <i>far far</i> superior life form that looks down on us and thinks of us as mere bugs! A not-so-positive outlook for the survival of humanity ... 
<br>
<br>
I was thinking about it today again, thinking about what would happen when after the heroic efforts from the best minds of our planet, we finally make it to the doorstep of this superior species. Would they just immediately swat us like flies? Would they study us with curiosity? They certainly won't invite us to share a place next to them in their sophisticated society, would they? That's when a ray of hope hit me - What if they decide to teach us their knowledge? What if in their greater wisdom, they see something we don't? What if enabling us to survive, helps them survive? We could be of USE to them, just like many species on this planet are currently useful to us. 
<br>
<br>
Let's get back to crabs for a bit. The real crustacean crabs, not the metaphorical human crabs. Crabs provide little value to humans besides being an ingredient in some dishes. When early humans migrated across continents, they didn't take crabs with them. But think of the other species like cows, sheep, or horses, that we depended on for some unique services. We took them with us for a ride (pun totally intended). Maybe this was a lifeline for them and they survived longer than they were originally capable of. All because they were useful in some unique way to the dominant species. 
<br>
<br>
A similar lesson can also be learned from the Tleilaxu and the Ixians from the Dune universe. These human or human-like races clearly had no shot at creating a presence on multiple planets in the galaxy by themselves. They lacked the metal, the zest to achieve something like that. But both these races provided a critical service that nobody else could - Ixians manufacturing their complex machinery that flouts morality and the Tleilaxu with the secrets of their Axolotl tanks! Even when many great houses and the emperor despised them, they were "kept" around for they were irreplaceable. 
<br>
<br>
Given the probabilities, I think we should invest our resources into figuring out how can we be useful to some other dominant species rather than how can we be the dominant species ourselves. What is our "USP" in the big market? How can we be better crabs? Can we be the engineers? Can we be the manpower? Are we just going to be a source of entertainment? Is it possible that we have already discovered what we need to do? Is it possible that our super-powerful computers and LLMs are our ticket to survival? That seems unlikely given any species that dominates the whole galaxy certainly must have a tremendous amount of compute capability at their disposal. Is it our advances in the bio-medical field that allows us to create medicines to cure life-threatening illnesses? Again, that seems unlikely - what are the chances the advanced life form has any similarity with our body's composition? How about our keen sense for tactics and strategies in wars? Maybe! There are so many possibilities and I don't have the answer to that question, but I certainly hope it is something palatable and <i>humane</i>. The other possibility is we become a pest, a virus to this super-species that is just extremely difficult to wipe out. But again, is that really so much better of an option? I don't have a conclusion to this thought, a solution to the survival of the race. I just found it interesting that there is a very very high probability that the far future of humanity, if at all it exists might be very different from what we picture and what we depict in most science fiction. 
<br>
<br>
Now the warning that many have repeated before me: all this is assuming we <i>do</i> make it off this planet. If we don't look beyond immediate political gains and conflicts that won't matter in the long run, or destroy the planet too soon, we might as well just be some dead crabs on the seashore. And that is the real grim reminder.
